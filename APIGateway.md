## 🔷 What is an API Gateway?

An **API Gateway** is a **server** that acts as a **single entry point** into a system, typically used in **microservices architectures**. It sits between the **client (frontend)** and the **backend services** and is responsible for routing requests, composition, translation, and more.

Think of it as a **reverse proxy** — it receives API requests from clients, routes them to the appropriate service(s), and returns the aggregated results.

## 🔷 Why Use an API Gateway?

In a microservices environment, without an API Gateway:

* Clients would have to **call each service individually**.
* They’d need to know where each service lives (its IP, port, API shape).
* You’d have more problems with security, load balancing, monitoring, and more.

### 🔧 Problems Solved by an API Gateway:

* **Simplifies client communication**
* **Centralized authentication & authorization**
* **Load balancing**
* **Rate limiting & throttling**
* **Monitoring & logging**
* **Request/response transformation**
* **Aggregation** (combining multiple service responses into one)

## 🔷 Responsibilities of an API Gateway

| Responsibility                     | Description                                                         |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Routing**                        | Directs the request to the correct microservice                     |
| **Authentication & Authorization** | Verifies access via tokens like JWT                                 |
| **Rate Limiting**                  | Prevents overuse of services (e.g., 100 requests per minute per IP) |
| **Caching**                        | Stores frequently requested responses to improve performance        |
| **Request Transformation**         | Modifies request formats (e.g., JSON to gRPC, REST to SOAP)         |
| **Response Aggregation**           | Combines results from multiple services into a single response      |
| **Logging & Monitoring**           | Centralized request and error logging                               |
| **Security**                       | Protects internal services from exposure                            |

## 🔷 API Gateway vs Reverse Proxy

| Feature                 | API Gateway                                  | Reverse Proxy            |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Purpose                 | Business-aware routing, transformation, etc. | Basic traffic forwarding |
| Aware of Microservices  | Yes                                          | Not always               |
| Authentication          | Usually included                             | Not built-in             |
| Request Aggregation     | Yes                                          | No                       |
| Protocol Transformation | Often (e.g., REST to gRPC)                   | Typically no             |

## 🔷 How API Gateways Work – Flow Diagram

1. **Client** sends an HTTP request.
2. **API Gateway** intercepts the request.
3. It validates tokens (auth), applies rate limiting, etc.
4. It routes the request to the appropriate **microservice(s)**.
5. If necessary, it aggregates responses.
6. It returns the response to the client.

```
Client --> API Gateway --> Auth Service
                            |--> Product Service
                            |--> Order Service
                            --> Aggregated Response --> Client
```

## 🔷 When to Use API Gateway

✅ You have multiple microservices
✅ You want centralized authentication
✅ You need to rate limit or throttle clients
✅ You want a single entry point for clients
✅ You want to separate concerns between frontend/backend

---

## 🔷 Pros and Cons

### ✅ Pros:

* Centralized management of requests
* Easier to enforce security policies
* Reduces complexity for clients
* Enables service evolution behind the scenes

### ❌ Cons:

* Single point of failure (unless made highly available)
* Adds latency if not optimized
* Can become a bottleneck
* Needs to be maintained and scaled

---

## 🔷 Real-World Example

Let’s say you have an **e-commerce platform** with services:

* **AuthService**
* **ProductService**
* **OrderService**
* **PaymentService**

Instead of the frontend calling each of these services individually, it calls:

```http
GET https://api.mystore.com/user/orders
```

The **API Gateway**:

1. Authenticates the request.
2. Calls `AuthService` to get user data.
3. Calls `OrderService` for order history.
4. Calls `ProductService` to enrich orders with product details.
5. Aggregates and returns the result to the frontend.

## 🔷 Common Features in an Enterprise API Gateway

* OAuth2/JWT-based auth
* Swagger/OpenAPI support
* Service discovery (with Consul, Eureka, etc.)
* Canary deployment support
* Circuit breaker / Retry mechanisms
* gRPC/GraphQL support

---

## 🔷 Bonus: Microservices Without API Gateway?

It’s possible, but you’d have to:

* Build logic for service discovery, load balancing, etc., into the client.
* Expose internal services to the internet.
* Handle cross-cutting concerns in every microservice.

That’s **not scalable** or **secure**, which is why API Gateways are so common in modern architectures.
