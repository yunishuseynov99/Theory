### **How `async` and `await` Work in C#**

In C#, `async` and `await` provide a way to write asynchronous code in a readable and maintainable way. Under the hood, they rely on **tasks (`Task` and `Task<T>`)**, the **Task-based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP)**, and **state machines** generated by the compiler.

---

## **1. Basic Overview**

* The `async` keyword marks a method as asynchronous.
* The `await` keyword pauses execution until the awaited task completes, allowing other code to run in the meantime.
* The method **does not block the calling thread** while waiting for the result.

```csharp
async Task<int> GetDataAsync()
{
    await Task.Delay(1000); // Simulates an asynchronous delay
    return 42;
}
```

## **2. What Happens Under the Hood?**

### **Step 1: Compiler Transforms the Method**

When you write an `async` method, the C# compiler **rewrites it into a state machine**. The rewritten method follows these steps:

1. **Breaks execution into multiple states** (before `await`, during `await`, and after `await`).
2. **Stores local variables in a state machine object**, so execution can be resumed later.
3. **Uses a continuation** to resume execution once the awaited task completes.

Example:

```csharp
async Task<int> ComputeAsync()
{
    int result = await SomeAsyncMethod();
    return result + 10;
}
```

The compiler **transforms** this into:

```csharp
Task<int> ComputeAsync()
{
    var stateMachine = new ComputeAsyncStateMachine();
    stateMachine.MoveNext(); // Starts execution
    return stateMachine.Task; // Returns the task that completes later
}
```

---

### **Step 2: `await` Keyword Behavior**

The `await` keyword **does not block the thread**. Instead, it does the following:

1. Calls `.GetAwaiter()` on the task (this returns a `TaskAwaiter`).
2. Checks if the task is already completed:

   * If **completed**, execution continues immediately.
   * If **not completed**, execution is paused, and a **continuation** is registered to resume execution once the task completes.
3. When the task completes, the continuation runs, restoring local variables and jumping back into the method.

#### **How `await` Works Internally**

```csharp
var awaiter = someTask.GetAwaiter();
if (!awaiter.IsCompleted)
{
    awaiter.OnCompleted(ContinueExecution);
    return; // Exit the method (state machine will resume later)
}

ContinueExecution();
```

---

### **Step 3: Continuations and Threading**

* By default, `await` **captures the current synchronization context** and continues on the same thread.
* In console apps or background services, there's no UI thread, so it continues on a **thread pool thread**.
* If you use `.ConfigureAwait(false)`, the continuation runs on a **thread pool thread** instead of the original context.

Example:

```csharp
await SomeAsyncMethod().ConfigureAwait(false);
```

* This is **useful for performance** in non-UI applications.

## **3. Example of a Full Transformation**

### **Async Code**

```csharp
async Task<int> ExampleAsync()
{
    Console.WriteLine("Start");
    await Task.Delay(1000);
    Console.WriteLine("End");
    return 42;
}
```

### **Compiler-Generated Code (Simplified)**

```csharp
class ExampleAsyncStateMachine : IAsyncStateMachine
{
    public int state;
    public TaskAwaiter taskAwaiter;
    public AsyncTaskMethodBuilder<int> builder;

    public void MoveNext()
    {
        if (state == 0)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Start");
            taskAwaiter = Task.Delay(1000).GetAwaiter();

            if (!taskAwaiter.IsCompleted)
            {
                state = 1;
                taskAwaiter.OnCompleted(MoveNext);
                return;
            }
        }

        if (state == 1)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("End");
            builder.SetResult(42);
        }
    }
}
```

## **4. Summary**

1. **Async methods are rewritten into state machines** by the compiler.
2. **Await does not block**; instead, it registers a continuation that resumes execution when the awaited task completes.
3. **Local variables and execution state are preserved** inside a state machine.
4. **Synchronization Context affects execution** (UI thread in WinForms/WPF, thread pool otherwise).
5. **ConfigureAwait(false)** can improve performance by preventing UI context capture.
