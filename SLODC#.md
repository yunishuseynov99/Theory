Sure! The **SOLID** principles are a set of five design principles in object-oriented programming (OOP) that, when followed, help developers write more maintainable, flexible, and scalable code. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin (also known as Uncle Bob) to help developers create software that is easier to understand, modify, and extend. The SOLID acronym stands for:

1. **S** - **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
2. **O** - **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
3. **L** - **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
4. **I** - **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
5. **D** - **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

Let's go through each principle in-depth with C# examples.

### 1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

**Definition**:  
A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should only have one job or responsibility.

**Explanation**:  
If a class is responsible for more than one thing, it becomes harder to understand and maintain. If the class has more than one responsibility, a change to one part of the functionality might affect other unrelated parts.

**Example**:

**Bad Example (violating SRP)**:
```csharp
public class Invoice
{
    public void GenerateInvoice() 
    {
        // Logic to generate invoice
    }

    public void SaveInvoiceToDatabase()
    {
        // Logic to save invoice in database
    }

    public void SendInvoiceEmail()
    {
        // Logic to send invoice email
    }
}
```

Here, the `Invoice` class is doing too many things: generating, saving, and emailing the invoice. If any of these responsibilities change, we have to modify this class.

**Good Example (following SRP)**:
```csharp
public class Invoice
{
    public void GenerateInvoice() 
    {
        // Logic to generate invoice
    }
}

public class InvoiceRepository
{
    public void SaveInvoiceToDatabase(Invoice invoice)
    {
        // Logic to save invoice in database
    }
}

public class EmailService
{
    public void SendInvoiceEmail(Invoice invoice)
    {
        // Logic to send invoice email
    }
}
```

Now, each class has a single responsibility, making it easier to modify and maintain.

### 2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**

**Definition**:  
Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

**Explanation**:  
You should be able to add new functionality to an existing class without modifying its existing code. Instead of altering the class, you extend it via inheritance or interfaces.

**Example**:

**Bad Example (violating OCP)**:
```csharp
public class DiscountCalculator
{
    public double CalculateDiscount(Customer customer)
    {
        if (customer.Type == "Regular")
        {
            return 0.1;  // 10% discount for regular customers
        }
        else if (customer.Type == "Premium")
        {
            return 0.2;  // 20% discount for premium customers
        }

        return 0;
    }
}
```

Here, adding a new type of customer would require modifying the `DiscountCalculator` class.

**Good Example (following OCP)**:
```csharp
public interface IDiscountStrategy
{
    double CalculateDiscount(Customer customer);
}

public class RegularDiscount : IDiscountStrategy
{
    public double CalculateDiscount(Customer customer)
    {
        return 0.1;
    }
}

public class PremiumDiscount : IDiscountStrategy
{
    public double CalculateDiscount(Customer customer)
    {
        return 0.2;
    }
}

public class DiscountCalculator
{
    private readonly IDiscountStrategy _discountStrategy;

    public DiscountCalculator(IDiscountStrategy discountStrategy)
    {
        _discountStrategy = discountStrategy;
    }

    public double CalculateDiscount(Customer customer)
    {
        return _discountStrategy.CalculateDiscount(customer);
    }
}
```

Now, we can add new discount strategies (like `GoldDiscount`) without modifying the existing `DiscountCalculator` class. We extend the functionality through new classes.

### 3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**

**Definition**:  
Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

**Explanation**:  
This principle ensures that a derived class can stand in for its base class without introducing errors. A derived class should not override or modify the behavior of the base class in ways that break functionality.

**Example**:

**Bad Example (violating LSP)**:
```csharp
public class Bird
{
    public virtual void Fly() 
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Flying...");
    }
}

public class Ostrich : Bird
{
    public override void Fly()
    {
        // Ostriches cannot fly, so this method is incorrect for them
        throw new InvalidOperationException("Ostriches cannot fly.");
    }
}
```

Here, `Ostrich` is a subclass of `Bird`, but it cannot fly. Replacing a `Bird` object with an `Ostrich` breaks the code.

**Good Example (following LSP)**:
```csharp
public class Bird
{
    public virtual void Move() 
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Flying...");
    }
}

public class Sparrow : Bird
{
    public override void Move()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Flying...");
    }
}

public class Ostrich : Bird
{
    public override void Move()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Running...");
    }
}
```

Now, both `Sparrow` and `Ostrich` are subclasses of `Bird` and fulfill the general behavior of a bird moving, but in ways that are appropriate for each subclass.

### 4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**

**Definition**:  
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

**Explanation**:  
Instead of having a large, all-encompassing interface, break it down into smaller, more specific interfaces. This allows clients to implement only the methods they actually need.

**Example**:

**Bad Example (violating ISP)**:
```csharp
public interface IWorker
{
    void Work();
    void Eat();
}

public class Employee : IWorker
{
    public void Work()
    {
        // Work logic
    }

    public void Eat()
    {
        // Eating logic
    }
}

public class Robot : IWorker
{
    public void Work()
    {
        // Work logic
    }

    public void Eat()
    {
        throw new NotImplementedException();  // Robots don't eat, violating ISP
    }
}
```

Here, `Robot` is forced to implement `Eat()`, even though it doesnâ€™t make sense for a robot to do so.

**Good Example (following ISP)**:
```csharp
public interface IWorkable
{
    void Work();
}

public interface IEatable
{
    void Eat();
}

public class Employee : IWorkable, IEatable
{
    public void Work()
    {
        // Work logic
    }

    public void Eat()
    {
        // Eating logic
    }
}

public class Robot : IWorkable
{
    public void Work()
    {
        // Work logic
    }
}
```

Now, `Robot` implements only the interface it needs, and `Employee` implements both interfaces.

---

### 5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

**Definition**:  
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

**Explanation**:  
The idea is to decouple high-level logic from low-level implementation details. Instead of the high-level module directly depending on the low-level module, both should depend on an abstraction (like an interface).

**Example**:

**Bad Example (violating DIP)**:
```csharp
public class FileManager
{
    private readonly DatabaseService _databaseService;

    public FileManager()
    {
        _databaseService = new DatabaseService();  // Direct dependency
    }

    public void SaveFile(string filePath)
    {
        _databaseService.Save(filePath);
    }
}

public class DatabaseService
{
    public void Save(string data)
    {
        // Logic to save data
    }
}
```

Here, `FileManager` depends directly on `DatabaseService`. If we need to change the database service or use a different implementation, we have to modify `FileManager`.

**Good Example (following DIP)**:
```csharp
public interface IDataService
{
    void Save(string data);
}

public class DatabaseService : IDataService
{
    public void Save(string data)
    {
        // Logic to save data to database
    }
}

public class FileManager
{
    private readonly IDataService _dataService;

    public FileManager(IDataService dataService)
    {
        _dataService = dataService;  // Dependency injection
    }

    public void SaveFile(string filePath)
    {
        _dataService.Save(filePath);
    }
}
```

Now, `FileManager` depends on the abstraction (`IDataService`), and you can inject any service that implements `IDataService`, making it easier to change the underlying storage system.

### Conclusion
